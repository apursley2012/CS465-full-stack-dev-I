## Access Requirements

This application requires a **computer** to run the backend server and a modern **web browser** to access it.

To run the app locally:

1. Start the backend server on your computer:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000/
    ```

> **Note:**  
> Mobile devices such as iPhones and Android phones cannot run the backend server and thus cannot access the app locally unless it is deployed to a remote host accessible via the internet.
